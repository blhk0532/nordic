# Contributing to Layup

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get started.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Crumbls/layup.git
cd layup

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Run tests
vendor/bin/pest

# Run code style fixer
vendor/bin/pint

# Run static analysis / refactoring
vendor/bin/rector --dry-run
```

## Code Style

Layup uses [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/pint) with the Laravel preset. Run it before committing:

```bash
vendor/bin/pint
```

The pre-push hook runs Pint in `--test` mode and Pest automatically. If either fails, the push is blocked.

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
vendor/bin/pest

# Specific file
vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/WidgetTest.php

# Filter by name
vendor/bin/pest --filter="renders heading widget"

# Parallel (faster)
vendor/bin/pest --parallel
```

## Writing Tests

Tests live in `tests/Unit/` and `tests/Feature/`. We use [Pest](https://pestphp.com/).

**Widget tests** should cover:
- Default data structure
- Form schema returns valid Filament components
- Preview renders something useful
- Frontend rendering produces correct HTML
- Edge cases (empty data, missing fields, long content)

**Feature tests** should cover:
- Artisan commands
- HTTP routes (frontend rendering)
- Full page builder lifecycle

Example widget test:

```php
it('renders with default data', function () {
    $widget = new MyWidget(['data' => MyWidget::getDefaultData()]);
    $html = $widget->render()->render();

    expect($html)->toBeString()->not->toBeEmpty();
});

it('has valid form schema', function () {
    $schema = MyWidget::getContentFormSchema();

    expect($schema)->toBeArray()->not->toBeEmpty();
    expect($schema[0])->toBeInstanceOf(\Filament\Forms\Components\Component::class);
});
```

## Building Custom Widgets

See the [Custom Widgets](README.md#custom-widgets) section in the README. The short version:

1. Extend `Crumbls\Layup\View\BaseWidget`
2. Implement `getType()`, `getLabel()`, `getContentFormSchema()`, `getDefaultData()`, `render()`
3. Drop it in `App\Layup\Widgets` (auto-discovered) or register via config/plugin

If you're building a widget package for others to use, publish it as a Composer package with a service provider that registers the widgets.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
2. Write tests for your changes
3. Run `vendor/bin/pint` and `vendor/bin/pest`
4. Open a PR with a clear description of what and why

Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR. Large refactors should be discussed in an issue first.

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue with:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce (minimal example)
- PHP, Laravel, and Filament versions
